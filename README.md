# cloudflight-coding-contest

Use the main branch as a template for each new Cloudflight Coding Contest!

Just use:

```
git checkout -b nth
```

to create a new branch for the n-th Cloudflight Coding Context...

If more teams are participating, add a dash and the first letters of the forenames of the team members after the branch name:

This is an example:

```
git checkout -b 38th-cf
```

because in the 38th Cloudflight Coding Context, Clemens and Felix participated as a team.
